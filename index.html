    <details><summary>Javascript Introduction
    </summary>
    Javascript is a single threaded light weighted scripting language. Javascript is dynamically assigned or run time assigned.
    <p>Most of the web pages uses Javascript because it provides functionality to the web pages and provides possibility for dynamic manipulation of browser and document.</p>
    <p>Javascript consists of two special features.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>DOM</li>
        <li>BOM</li>
    </ol>
    <p>DOM is used to manipulate html Document</p>
    <p>BOM is used to manipulate the Browser.</p>
    <p>Javascript is easily understandable language.</p>
    <p>Javascript is compatible it can be used in frontend and backend.</p>
    <p>Javascript executed line by line and It uses interpreter for execution.</p>
    <p>Javascript can be involved in to html in two ways</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Internally</li>
        <li>Externally</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Internally means we can write the script tag directly in the body tag</p>
    <p>Externally means script will be written in .js file and is attached to html file in the last line of body tag</p>

        <summary>Variables</summary>
        Variables are the containers for storing the data. They are used to store and retrieve and to manipulate the data.
        <ol>
            <li>Variable Declaration</li>
            <p>Variable Declaration is used to declare a variable</p>
            <p>Syntax: var nameofthevariable;</p>
            <p>ex: var a;</p>
            <p>Var is a keyword used to declare the scope the variable.</p>
            <li>Variable Assignment</li>
            <p>Variable Assignment is to assign a value to a variable. Before assigning a value it is undefined and then we reassign to a value.</p>
            <p>Syntax: variablename=value;</p>
            <p>ex: a=10;</p>
            <li>Variable Initialization</li>
            <p>
              Variable Initialization means here both Variable Declaration and
              Variable Assignment will be done at a time
            </p>
            <p>Syntax: Var a=15;</p>
            <p>Variables can be declared as x=5 means x stores the value 5</p>
          </ol>
          <h3>Hoisting</h3>
          <p>In Javascript all the variable declarations will goes to top of the code even before execution.This process is called as Hoisting. Only the declaration will goes up and declaration in initialization will goes up.</p>

          <h4>Rules for Declaring a variable:</h4>
            <p>Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that x and X are different variables.</p>
            <p>Variable names must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).</p>
            <p>Variable names cannot contain spaces.</p>
            <p>Variable names cannot start with a number.</p>
            <p>A variable name cannot be a reserved keyword.</p>
        </details>

        <summary>Data Types</summary>
        <p>Data Types defines the type of data that is stored in a variable. Data Types are of two types.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Primitive </li>
            <li>Non-Primitive</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Primitive Data Types</h4>
        <p>The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known as primitive data types. Primitive data types are also known as in-built data types.</p>
        <p>Primitive Data Types are immutable means cannot change the data</p>
        <p>Primitive Data Types are stored by values i.e. pass by value and call by value</p>
        <p>Primitive Data is stored in Stack</p>
        <p>Primitive Data Types are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Number</li>
            <p>Any number which we get in any form</p>
            <li>String</li>
            <p>Collection of characters enclosed in single quotes or double quotes.</p>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <p>True or False</p>
            <li>Null</li>
            <p>In J.S. Null means 0. Null is not predefined</p>
            <li>Undefined</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Non-Primitive Data Types</h4>
        <p>Non-Primitive Data Types are the collections formed from primitive data. Non-primitive Data types are mutable.</p>
        <p>Non-Primitive Data Types are passed by using Reference i.e. Call by Reference and Pass by Reference</p>
        <p>Non-Primitive Data is stored in Heap.</p>
        <p>Non-primitive Data Types are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrays</li>
            <p>used to represent collection of data</p>
            <p>Collection of any data separated by comma and enclosed in [] is called an array</p>
            <li>Objects</li>
            <p>Used to represent collection of data in key value pairs</p>
            <p>Collection of data in key-value pairs separated by comma and enclosed in {}</p>
        </ol>
    </details>
