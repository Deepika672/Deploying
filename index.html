    <p>Basically, all scripting languages are programming languages. The theoretical difference between the two is that scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted.</p>
    <h2>Programming Language</h2>
    <p>A programming language is a combination of words and symbols that is used to write programs, and these programs are set of instructions. A programming language is a way by which programmers communicate with computers through the set of instructions known as code/program."</p>
    <h2>Scripting Language</h2>
    <p>A scripting language is a type of programming language which does not require explicit compilation step, and it is designed for a runtime system to automate the execution of tasks."
