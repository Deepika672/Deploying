      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>
        Variables are the Containers for storing the data.Variables can be used
        to store multiple data. Generally Variables consists of three parts
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Variable Declaration</li>
        <p>Variable Declaration is used to declare a variable</p>
        <p>Syntax: var a;</p>
        <li>Variable Assignment</li>
        <p>Variable Assignment is to assign a value to a variable</p>
        <p>Syntax: a=10;</p>
        <li>Variable Initialization</li>
        <p>
          Variable Initialization means here both Variable Declaration and
          Variable Assignment will be done at a time
        </p>
        <p>Syntax: Var a=15;</p>
        <p>Variables can be declared as x=5 means x stores the value 5</p>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Data Types</h2>
      <p>
        There are several data types to represent different kinds of values.
        Data Types are attributes that are predefined or can be created by the
        user so that the program can easily detect the different types of
        information. These data types include:
      </p>
      <p>Data Types are of two types: primitive and Non-Primitive</p>
      <p>Primitive Data Types are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>String</li>
        <p>
          Represents textual data and is enclosed in single or double quotes.
        </p>
        <li>Boolean</li>
        <p>Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.</p>
        <li>Num</li>
        <p>Represents true or false values. let isStudent = true;</p>
      </ol>
      <p>Non-Primitive Data Types include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Array</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Used to store ordered collections of values. Denoted by []</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Operators</h2>
      <p>
        Operators are those which are used to perform operation on the data.
        Depending on its type, an operator manipulates an arithmetic or logical
        value, or operand, in a specific way to generate a specific result.
      </p>
      <p>Types of Operators includes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Arithemetic Operators</li>
        <li>Assignment operators</li>
        <li>Logical Operators</li>
        <li>Comparision Operators</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Arithemetic Operators</h4>
      <p>
        Arithemetic Operators are used to perform mathematical operation on the
        given data. Arithemetic operators include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Addition +</li>
        <p>Used to perform Addition between two variables</p>
        <li>Subtraction -</li>
        <p>Used to perform Subtraction between two variables</p>
        <li>Multiplication *</li>
        <p>Used to perform Multiplication between two variables</p>
        <li>Modulus %</li>
        <p>Used to perform Modulus operation</p>
        <li>Division /</li>
        <p>Used to perform Division operation</p>
      </ol>
      <h4>Assignment Operators</h4>
      <p>Assignment operators are used to assign values</p>
      <p>a=10 Here we are assigning 10 to a</p>
      <p>Assignment operators include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Assignment (=)</li>
        <p>
          This operator assigns the right operand value to the left operand.
        </p>
        <p>Example: A = 10</p>
        <li>Addition Assignment (+=)</li>
        <p>
          Sums up left and right operand values and then assigns the result to
          the left operand.
        </p>
        <p>Y += 1 gives Y = Y + 1</p>
        <li>Subtraction Assignment (- =)</li>
        <p>
          It subtracts the right side value from the left side value and then
          assigns the result to the left operand
        </p>
        <p>Y -= 1 gives Y = Y â€“ 1</p>
        <li>Multiplication Assignment (*=)</li>
        <p>
          It multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns
          the result to the variable
        </p>
        <p>Y *= A is equivalent to Y = Y * A</p>
        <li>Division Assignment (/ =)</li>
        <p>
          It divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns
          the result to the variable.
        </p>
        <p>Y /= A is equivalent to Y = Y / A</p>
        <li>Modules/Remainder Assignment (% =)</li>
        <p>
          It divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns
          the
        </p>
      </ol>
      <h4>Logical Operators</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>AND(&&)</li>
        <li>OR(||)</li>
        <li>NOT(!)</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Comparision Operators</h4>
      <p>
        These are used to compare two or more values.These operators are mainly
        used to perform the logical operations that determine the equality or
        difference between the values.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Equality (==)</li>
        <li>Strict equality (===)</li>
        <li>Inequality (!=)</li>
        <li>Strict inequality(!==)</li>
        <li>Greater than (>)</li>
        <li>Less than (<)</li>
        <li>Greater than or Equal to (> =)</li>
        <li>Less than or Equal to (<= )</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Control Structures</h2>
      <p>Control Structures consists of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Loops</li>
        <li>Conditional Statements</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Loops</h4>
      <p>
        Loops are used to execute a block of code more than one time. Loops are
        of 3 types
      </p>
      <p>For, While, Do-While</p>
      <pre>
Syntax of for loop: for (initialization; testing condition; increment/decrement) {
            statement(s)
        }
        </pre
      >
      <pre>
Syntax of while loop: while (boolean condition) 
            {
            loop statements...
            }
        </pre
      >
      <pre>
Syntax of Do-While Loop: do {
            Statements...
        }
        while (condition);
        </pre
      >
      <h4>Conditional Statements</h4>
      <p>
        Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program
        based on certain conditions. They enable you to make decisions and
        execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is
        true or false.
      </p>
      <p>These include: If, If else, Else if ladder</p>
